TODO
====
* parse the content of /etc/zypp/repos.d instead of hardcoding only one source
  in zyp-file.sh
* use the following file lists instead of ARCHIVES.gz which is not always
  present; according to the repository type:
	* yast2
		suse/setup/descr/packages.gz
		Availabe in the local cache, /var/cache/zypp/raw
	* rpm-md
		repodata/*-filelists.xml.gz
		The actual name of the file is available in
		repodata/repomd.xml. repomd.xml is in the local cache but the
		file list is not, it must be retrieved from the repository's
		url.
